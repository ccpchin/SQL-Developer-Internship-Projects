# Airline Reservation System

This project simulates a flight booking system with a SQLite-based backend and a machine learning model for predicting no-show passengers. It covers core functionalities such as flight management, dynamic pricing, booking, cancellations, audit logs, and analytics.

## Key Features:
- SQLite-powered schema with `Flights`, `Bookings`, and `Booking_Audit` tables.
- Booking logic with seat availability and audit trail.
- Flight search with filters for source, destination, and date.
- Dynamic pricing and seat inventory management.
- ML model (Logistic Regression) to predict likely no-show passengers.
- Summary reports grouped by airline bookings.
- Exception logging for robust error tracking.

This was developed as part of a data science and backend internship challenge and focuses on clean schema design, logic implementation, and predictive modeling.
